# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Verion control is tracking what changes have been made to a project, when they were made, and who made them. It allows you to backtrack if something went wrong, and improves coordination in group work.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is a version of the code with alterations. It's useful because it allows you to preserve the original code unaltered until you know the new code works.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is a save point in git. A good commit message provides details about what was changed in that.

* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict is when there is a difference between the master and branch, often caused by the master being altered since the branch was separated, that prevents the merge from going smoothly.

WHOOOOOAAAAA HEY THERE EVERYBODY!
